# An Agent-Based Model of Monocyte Differentiation into Tumor-Associated Macrophages in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia

## Summary

This repository contains data related to the publication [An Agent-Based Model of Monocyte Differentiation into Tumor-Associated Macrophages in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.17.473137v3) by Verstraete et al. 

It presents an agent-based model (ABM) describing the differentiation dynamics of monocytes into tumour-associated macrophages upon contact with cancer B cells in the context of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. 

The goal of this ABM is to reproduce dynamics compatible with an *in vitro* experimental setting of monocytes differentiation in presence of leukemic (B-CLL).

The model can be run online at [https://www.netlogoweb.org/](https://www.netlogoweb.org/).

To do this: 
- download the NetLogo model [here](https://github.com/VeraPancaldiLab/Agent-Based-Model-of-NLC-in-CLL/blob/main/netlogo/ABM_NLC_CLL.nlogo) (`right click` the `Raw` button at the top of the file, select `Save Link Asâ€¦`, choose the location on your computer where you want to save the file, and select `Save`).
- go at [https://www.netlogoweb.org/](https://www.netlogoweb.org/)
- upload the model
- click `setup` and `go`.

## Project organisation
