# An Agent-Based Model of Monocyte Differentiation into Tumor-Associated Macrophages in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia

## Summary

This repository contains data related to the publication [An Agent-Based Model of Monocyte Differentiation into Tumor-Associated Macrophages in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.17.473137v3) by Verstraete et al. 

It presents an agent-based model (ABM) describing the differentiation dynamics of monocytes into tumour-associated macrophages upon contact with cancer B cells in the context of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. 

The goal of this ABM is to reproduce dynamics compatible with an *in vitro* experimental setting of monocytes differentiation in presence of leukemic (B-CLL).
