# Agent-Based-Model-of-NLC-in-CLL

## Summary
This repository contains data related to an agent-based model (ABM) describing the differentiation dynamics of monocytes into tumour-associated macrophages upon contact with cancer B cells in the context of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The goal of this ABM is to reproduce dynamics compatible with an *in vitro* experimental setting of monocytes differentiation in presence of leukemic (B-CLL) described [here](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/14/1/16/htm).

## Project organisation
- **netlogo** source file for the agent-based model. The model can be run with NetLogo 6.1.0 or online at https://www.netlogoweb.org/ (press 'setup', then 'go').
- **openmole** source files for exploring the model on the OpenMOLE platform https://openmole.org
- **figures** source files to generate the figures and analysis of the related publication
